## I followed a tutorial that combines the basic elements of the Phaser.js game-building framework.
## I combined two of the elements I learned in this simple example; it's got two boxes that when clicked on play a sound file, and a sprite that moves when the arrow keys are pressed. I really enjoyed learning to use Phaser and look forward to building something more complex with it in the future!
